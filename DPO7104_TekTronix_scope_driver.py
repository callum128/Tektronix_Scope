class DPO7104_TekTronix_scope(RexSupport):
    """Driver for the Tektronix DPO7104 oscilloscope over GPIB using PyVISA.

    This class manages instrument connection, configuration, gated area integration, waveform
    capture, and optional forwarding of measurement payloads to a Rex server.

    The driver supports averaged acquisitions, cursor-based gated area measurements on CH1,
    raw waveform downloads for CH1 and CH2, and basic trigger setup on CH2.

    KNOWN FOOTGUNS:
    - Waveform downloads can be slow and massive may cause the scope's CPU to struggle, or even overfill the computer storage.
        TO FIX: try lowering the sampling rate, 100000 is the issue
    - Area measurement pulled from the scope vs area calculated from the pulled waveform can differ, if the first 
        cursor is <1.0e-7s or negative, relative to the trigger. This is only an issue if you are setting the cursor 
        tiny and trying to compare the area measurement to a calculated area from the waveform, if you are just 
        using the area measurement as a relative metric, such as for emission scans, then this is not a problem.
    - This driver assume a negative PMT output and inverts the area measurement accordingly, if you are have  
        a positive signal you will need to multiply the area by -1 to get the correct polarity.
    - The SCOPE_ADDRESS and RESOURCE_MANAGER may need to be adjusted depending on your specific GPIB connection. 
    - If you do not know the strongest transition to maunally set the vertical scale for, you can run a quick emission scan and
        look at the CH1 waveform data (on the scope) to find the max peak, then set the vertical scale so that this peak fills
        the screen, this will hopefully ensure all peaks are relative and do not go offscreen.

    Attributes:
        state (int): Measurement cycle counter.
        connect_to_rex (bool): Whether to forward payloads to a Rex server link.
        sock (socket | None): TCP socket used for Rex forwarding.
        scope: PyVISA resource for the connected oscilloscope.
        measurements (dict): Stored Measurement objects for area, waveform, trigger, and timing.
        averages (int): Number of waveform acquisitions to average.
        start_bound (float): Left cursor position relative to the trigger.
        end_bound (float): Right cursor position relative to the trigger.
        area_enabled (bool): Whether gated area measurements are enabled.
        waveform_enabled (bool): Whether CH1 waveform capture is enabled.
        trigger_enabled (bool): Whether CH2 trigger waveform capture is enabled.

    Methods:
        open_connection(): Open the instrument connection and verify identity.
        set_config(): Apply configuration and prepare acquisition settings.
        set_cursors(): Configure vertical cursor positions and gated area measurement.
        measure_area(): Acquire gated area and convert polarity for PMT output.
        measure_waveform(channel=1): Download and scale waveform data from the given channel.
        measure(): Run enabled measurements and optionally send the payload to Rex.
        full_autoset(): Execute the instrument autoset sequence.
        close(): Close the PyVISA resource safely.
